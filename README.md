# Loan-Prediction-System
Python, Machine Learning, SVM, KNN, Random forest, and Naive Bayes



## Overview
The Loan Prediction System is designed to predict loan approval outcomes based on various factors. Utilizing machine learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN, and RandomForestClassifier, this project aims to provide accurate predictions to assist in decision-making processes. The system is developed in Python, leveraging libraries like scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and more for data processing and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Explore and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and correlation between different variables.
- **Model Training**: Implements machine learning models including SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), RandomForest, and Naive Bayes to predict loan approval.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the accuracy of different models to identify the most effective predictor.
